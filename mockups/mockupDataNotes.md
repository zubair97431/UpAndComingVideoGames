- Created mock dataset to reflect the content of a provisional database. Mockup data referenced from Steam Game Library data (games-features.csv). 

- Columns include samples of various game features, such as platform, player count, critic rating, and different genres. 

- Target Variable: [----]

# Machine Learning Model

- Prediction or Classification: [----]

- Possible Models: 

# Notes: 

- Confirm the columns to use from available data with team.

- Confirm process to retrieve data, if data-scraping is required or a static database with established content. Provide reasoning for documentation and presentation purposes. 

- Determine a Prediction or Classification learning model and draft model code with mock dataset. 

- Deliverables: 
    - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema. 

    - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database. 

    - Takes in data in from the provisional database. 

    - Outputs label(s) for input data.
